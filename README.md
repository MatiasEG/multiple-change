# Multiple change on credibility orders

## About this application

In this application, we focus on credibility dynamics. We implement a prioritized multiple revision operator that can be used to revise one credibility order by another credibility order. To visualize the behavior of the operator, we provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows to handle credibility orders and apply the change operator. This GUI has some visual tools to explain the revision process.
